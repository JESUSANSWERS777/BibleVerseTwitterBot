# MyBot
A twitter bot that finds bible verses and retweets them.

Currently the MyBot class searches for the hashtag #verseoftheday and retweets the first one found. I wanted to use this bot to send my personal twitter account a daily bible verse. It is currently set to send out one retweet and then sleep for 24 hours. The Bots user name is @HeIsRisenBot. 

Uses  twitter4j library  found at http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html
